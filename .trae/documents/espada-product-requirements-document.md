## 3. Core Process

### Customer Shopping Flow
Customers begin their journey on the homepage, where they can explore featured collections and navigate to specific categories (Sudo, XVII, Teyo). From there, they browse the product catalog using filters and search functionality. Upon selecting a product, they view detailed information and add items to their cart. The checkout process guides them through providing contact information, shipping details, and payment, culminating in order confirmation.

### Admin Management Flow
Administrators access the system through a secure login page, then navigate to the admin dashboard where they can manage products (add, edit, delete), process orders (view, update status), analyze business metrics, and manage customer relationships. The admin panel provides comprehensive tools for inventory management, order fulfillment, and business intelligence.

### 5.3 Database Migration Plan

**Current State:** JSON files (`products.json`, `orders.json`)

2. Create database schema for products, orders, customers, and admin users
3. Implement Supabase client configuration
4. Create data migration scripts to transfer JSON data
5. Update API routes to use Supabase instead of file system
6. Implement real-time subscriptions for live updates
7. Add Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(100),
  sizes TEXT[],
  colors TEXT[],
  images TEXT[],
  stock INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  customer_email VARCHAR(255),
  items JSONB,
  total DECIMAL(10,2),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  shipping_address JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Customers table (for app.stack integration)
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
